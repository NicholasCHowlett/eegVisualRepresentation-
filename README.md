# A visual representation of an EEG recording

An electroencephalography recording will be captured via a low-cost, brain-computer interface developed by [OpenBCI](https://docs.openbci.com/GettingStarted/Boards/GanglionGS/). The EEG signal will be represented as [frequencies versus power](https://mne.tools/stable/auto_tutorials/intro/10_overview.html#time-frequency-analysis), which then will be used as input into a artistic representation that is visually experienced.

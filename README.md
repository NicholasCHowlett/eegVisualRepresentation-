# An artistic interpretation of an EEG recording
## Summary of process
An electroencephalography recording will be captured via a brain-computer interface. The EEG signal will then used as input into a artistic representation of the brainwaves acquired, which would be completed by artist [Britt Salt](http://brittsalt.com/).

## Parallising the process
This process could be conducted to generate an individually unique artwork, where the buyier could participate in development of the artwork by having their brainwaves incorporated in the piece. This process could be parallised, allowing a couple (or more) to obtain a combination of artwork pieces that are mostly reflective of their individual brain states.

## Requirements of project
This project uses a Python-based environment for most computation. In particular, it leans on the BrainFlow and MNE packages for processing of data. This EEG data is acquired from a low-cost, brain-computer interface developed by OpenBCI. For more information relating to these details check out the following, which is foundational to this project: [Acquiring & processing an electroencephalography signal](https://github.com/NicholasCHowlett/eegDataAnalysis).

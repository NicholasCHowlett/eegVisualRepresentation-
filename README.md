# A visual representation of an electroencephalography (EEG) recording

The EEG recording will be captured from a low-cost, brain-computer interface developed by [OpenBCI](https://docs.openbci.com/GettingStarted/Boards/GanglionGS/). The EEG signal will be represented as [frequencies (versus power)](https://mne.tools/stable/auto_tutorials/intro/10_overview.html#time-frequency-analysis), then will be used as the input into a visual (artistic) representation.

The current project scope will be the first attempt of a neuro-feedback system, where the real-time brain activity is artistically (visually) experienced by the participant.

# A visual representation of an electroencephalography (EEG) recording

The EEG recording will be captured from a low-cost, brain-computer interface developed by OpenBCI. The EEG signal will be represented as frequencies (versus power), then will be used as the input into a visual (artistic) representation.

The current project scope will be the first attempt of a neuro-feedback system, where the real-time brain activity is artistically (visually) experienced by the participant.

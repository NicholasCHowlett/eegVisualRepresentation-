# A visual representation of an EEG recording

An electroencephalography recording will be captured via a low-cost, brain-computer interface developed by [OpenBCI](https://docs.openbci.com/GettingStarted/Boards/GanglionGS/). The EEG signal will be represented as [frequencies versus power](https://mne.tools/stable/auto_tutorials/intro/10_overview.html#time-frequency-analysis), which then will be used as input into a artistic representation that can be visually experienced.

Then, another EEG recording will be captured. This recording will be from the same participant as the previous recording. However under this scenario the participant will be viewing the previous artistic representation of their brainwaves.

Finally, the difference in brainwaves comparing the 1st to  2nd scenario will be determined (via further signal processing). This difference will be highlighted, in addition to both visual representations of both scenarios.
